# Computer Graphics Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments for my **Computer Graphics** course. Each assignment focuses on different concepts in computer graphics, including rendering, transformations, and 3D modeling.

## Repository Structure
### Assignment-0: 3D Cube & 2D Scene  

This assignment focuses on fundamental graphics programming concepts. It includes:  

- **3D Rotating Cube:** A simple OpenGL-rendered cube with transformations like rotation and scaling.  
- **2D Scene:** A basic 2D environment featuring shapes and objects to understand rendering and transformations.  

This assignment helps in understanding coordinate systems, transformations, and basic OpenGL functions.  

## Requirements
To run the assignments, you may need:
- C++ / OpenGL / Python (as required)
- Libraries such as **GLUT**, **SDL**, or **Three.js** (depending on the assignment)
- A compatible graphics environment (e.g., OpenGL-supported system)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/harsheeka/computer-graphics-assignments.git
   cd computer-graphics-assignments
